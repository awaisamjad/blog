# Part 1
### Step 1 
Get the Advent of Code input. Mine looks like the following:
```
    "3x12x15\n
    24x25x17\n
    14x6x11\n"
    ...
``` 
### Step 2
Add that to a string

```rust
    let input = String::from("
    "3x12x15\n
    24x25x17\n
    14x6x11\n"
    ...
    ")
```
### Step 3
We need to seperate each box's dimension from others so will add them as values to an empty list

Declare a mutable empty list

```rust
    let mut values = vec![];
```
Then we will iterate over the each character in the input. If this character is equal to the line break then we will res
