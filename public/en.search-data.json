I used it during university and learnt many fundamnetal concepts such as variables, loops, functions, classes etc.\nYou can create many visual elements and shapes such as squares, lines, texts and basically do stuff with them\nBelow is a GIF of it in action\nüö´ Insert GIF ","how-it-works#How it works":"Processing itself isnt open source so we cant look at the code used to make it. But that doesnt mean we cant figure out how it basically works.\nThe text editor This is the main part of the processing apllication and where you write the code. At the top we can see some buttons, a run and stop button etc\nüö´ Insert Image The Output Window This is the output of what we instructed our code to do. Its the visual stuff\nüö´ Insert Image Interpreter Before our code can actually do something, it needs to be interpreted by another language to create a window with what we want. I dont know what language processing uses but for our clone we will be using Rust.\nbelow is a list of the technologies/tools we will be using\nTechnologies/Tools Tauri - A framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Frontend : Vanilla JavaScript Backend : Rust MiniFb - A cross platform library written in Rust that makes it easy to setup a window and to display a 32-bit pixel buffer. This will be used to make our graphics window WC Monaco Editor - An easy embed of the Monaco Editor. The Monaco Editor was made by Microsoft and is used by VSCode ","prerequisites#Prerequisites":"We can now start getting our tools\nRust This is the first step.\nTauri This is the second step.\nWC Monaco Editor "},"title":"Processing Clone"},"/blog/projects/resistor-resistance-calculator/":{"data":{"":"","#":" ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still in development Introduction [GitHub] Prerequisites Setup Project Structure Technologies used Steps Conclusion "},"title":"Resistor Resistance Calculator"}}
